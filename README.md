# Improved-Proxy-Server
Modified Proxy Server to Improve Network Security and Accessibility : In several business enterprises and educational institutes or even a whole country, we are  sometimes unable to access few of the websites through the network. This is because the  administration has only allowed access to few of the websites, mainly because to protect their  network from foreign intrusion or prevent spreading of false information. Some of the websites  are usually blocked by mistake and require a proxy server in order to access it, but it can lead  to accessing dangerous websites as well. In order to protect the network while being able to  use proxy server, additional rules will be incorporated to the proxy server along with providing  a facility for the proxy server to check for malicious connections before continuing further.
